Throughout this assignment we've used NPM Package and Node Module as if they are the same, 
while there are similarities, how do they differ from one another?

NPM is a package manager and installer.
Node Modules acts as a library for node, and can't download packages. 

If you create a new Node Module, how do you share that code with the community?
You could upload it to NPMJS.com and then further be able to share it with the community.
